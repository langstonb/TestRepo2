# Build Version Framework

The Build Version framework is a tool that automatically pulls git repository / PC information, and conveniently adds it to an AS project. This makes it very quick and easy to display this information directly on the mapp View HMI.

**This allows you to always be certain exactly which version of the software is running on the machine!**

The build version framework installer is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/br-na-pm/BuildVersionProject/releases/tag/V1.0.0)\. Note that to import this framework into your AS project, you must have the [mapp Framework](https://github.com/br-automation-com/mapp-Framework/releases) installed as well in order to use the import tool. You arenâ€™t required to use the mapp Framework itself, but you do need to use the corresonding import tool.
