# Commits
## Commit Description

When committing to the repo, include the Jira ID (if applicable) at the beginning of the commit description, along with a short sentence about what you changed. 

[See here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for recommendations on writing commit messages.

Remember to commit often!

## How to Undo a Commit

The following resources explain the strategies for handling several different undo situations in Git:

* [Resource 1](https://dangitgit.com/)
* [Resoruce 2](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes)

These methods are executed directly in the terminal. To access the terminal, click the "Terminal" icon within your repo in Sourcetree at the top right.

## Reverse Commit

Instead of undoing a commit, you can also create a new commit which reverses all of the changes in the selected commit.

This can be executed directly from the Sourcetree History view via the right-click menu.

## Push to / Pull from the Remote

Any commits you make will be stored in your local repository.

In order to make the changes available to everyone else working on the project, you must  __push__  to the remote repository.

Similarly, in order to obtain the changes that other teammates have made, you must  __pull__  from the remote repository.
