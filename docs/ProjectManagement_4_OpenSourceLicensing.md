## How to Select and Open-Source License


If you are creating collaborative software that is intended to be shared and expanded upon (i.e. not a direct customer project), then you should include an open-source license with the code.

The following resources are available to help you select an open-source license:

* [The Legal Side of Open Source | Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/legal/#which-open-source-license-is-appropriate-for-my-project)
* [Licensing a repository \- GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository#choosing-the-right-license)
* [Choose an open source license | Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/)

If you are unsure what license to select, then the [MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) is recommended.
