# Project Management

## Agile Workflow

[This article](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/project-management-intro) provides a thorough overview of Agile project management, and how it compares to the traditional waterfall approach. Agile strategies are recommended. 


## Project Management Topics

For effective project management, the following topics must be addressed:

* Content Collaboration – to store information
* Issue Tracking – to manage tasks
* Hosting Service – to manage Git repositories

The subsequent resources identify the tools we use at B&R, which will therefore be referenced throughout the rest of the DevOps package.

## Content Collaboration

A content collaboration tool is needed to store information such as meeting notes, brainstorming, project planning, documentation, etc.

At B&R, we use Confluence. Alternate options that you can also consider include Microsoft Sharepoint, Notion, Guru, Stack Overflow for Teams, and so on.
