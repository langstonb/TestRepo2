## Installation

[Download here.](https://git-scm.com/downloads) Installation Considerations:

* Use default installations settings, except for selecting your preferred default text editor (e.g., Notepad++)
* After installation, run the provided script  __GitConfigHelper.bat__  to accomplish the following:
  * Change the default branch name to 'main' (as opposed to 'master')
  * Allow a secure connection
  * Set the credential manager to the Windows credential manager core

## Hosting Services

A hosting service enables you to manage a Git repository. 

There are many choices for hosting services\, but the two that we use at B&R are **Bitbucket** and **GitHub**. 

Alternatives include Microsoft Azure Repos, GitLab, Amazon AWS CodeCommit, and so on.

## Create a Repo

[Create a repository in Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver082/creating-repositories-1141978253.html)

[Create a repository in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) 

## Git Client

A Git client allows you to interact with the Git repository via a visual interface, without the command line.

Just as with the hosting service, there are many options for Git clients. At B&R, we use **Sourcetree**. 

Alternate options include Tortoise Git, Git Extensions, GitHub Desktop, and so on.
