# AS Project Settings

On the Build tab of the CPU properties, it is recommended to add the .git file extension to the list for "Objects ignored for build warnings 9232 and 9233".

This will prevent those warnings from triggering because .git files exist in the project directory which are not directly related to the project itself.
