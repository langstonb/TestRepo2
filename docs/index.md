# DevOps Package

Overview

# Current Problems

Software Development

__Have you or your engineers made comments like this?__

“It’s difficult to keep track of what still needs to be done in this project”

“I wish I could develop new features faster”

“I need to somehow figure out how to do more work with less people”

“I’m too busy fighting fires\, I don’t have time to improve my processes”

“It takes too long to deploy bugfixes in the field”

“I have a testing process\, but it’s tedious and time consuming”

“I don’t have a good systematic process for testing my code before deployment”

# Addressing the Problems

Customer Applications

One way to address these kinds of problems is a set of practices called  __[DevOps](https://www.atlassian.com/devops/what-is-devops)__
