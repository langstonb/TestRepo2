## What Information Should You Store?

Confluence is used to store project information such as:

* Big picture timelines
* Personnel lists
* Summary of Jira issues \(via a macro – not manually entered\)
* Application spec
* Meeting notes
* etc

Confluence is quite flexible in that you can add new pages and sections as you see fit.

Take care of project permissions!



## Confluence Space Template

Various Confluence project templates are available to help you organize your project.

You can also create your own template to be reused within your organization.

At B&R, our default template includes the pages shown below:

| Template Page | Description |
| | |
| Organizational | Contains buttons for easily creating meeting notes.<br />Contains summary lists of all open Jira issues and Confluence tasks. |
| Requirements | Allows you to input the project specification as individual requirement pages |
| Application | For storing a .zip copy of the project (optional – should use source control instead) |
| Project controlling | For defining big-picture deadlines |
| About | For listing out the relevant personnel at the customer and at B&R |
| Userlist | Lists out all people who have access to the Confluence space |
