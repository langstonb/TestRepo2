# Version Control

## Before we get started

There is a huge amount of great material online that covers the "what", "why", and "how" of version control.

In these materials, we will link to those external resources for general topics.

We will primarily focus here on the things that are specific to B&R.

## Build Version Framework

The Build Version framework is a tool that automatically pulls git repository and PC information, and adds it to an AS project to display directly on the mapp View HMI.

**This allows you to always be certain exactly which version of the software is running on the machine!**

The build version framework installer is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/br-na-pm/BuildVersionProject/releases/tag/V1.0.0)\. Note that to import this framework into your AS project, you must have the [mapp Framework](https://github.com/br-automation-com/mapp-Framework/releases) installed as well in order to use the import tool. You arenâ€™t required to use the mapp Framework itself, but you do need to use the corresonding import tool.
